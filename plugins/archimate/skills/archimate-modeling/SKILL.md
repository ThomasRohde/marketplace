# ArchiMate Modeling Fundamentals

ArchiMate is The Open Group's standard for enterprise architecture modeling, providing a visual language with **56 elements** across **6 core layers** connected by **11 relationship types**.

## The Six Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Key Elements |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Motivation** | Why (stakeholder concerns, goals) | Stakeholder, Driver, Goal, Requirement, Principle |
| **Strategy** | What enterprise intends to achieve | Capability, Resource, Value Stream, Course of Action |
| **Business** | Business operations | Business Actor, Role, Process, Function, Service, Object |
| **Application** | Software and data | Application Component, Service, Interface, Data Object |
| **Technology** | Infrastructure | Node, Device, System Software, Artifact, Network |
| **Implementation & Migration** | Change management | Work Package, Deliverable, Plateau, Gap |

## Three Fundamental Aspects

Every layer contains elements organized into three aspects:

- **Active Structure (Nouns)**: Elements that perform behavior—actors, components, nodes, interfaces
- **Behavior (Verbs)**: Activities performed—processes, functions, services, events
- **Passive Structure (Objects)**: Elements behavior acts upon—business objects, data objects, artifacts

## Element Selection Decision Guide

### Active Structure: Who/What Performs Behavior?

| Need to model... | Use | Not |
|------------------|-----|-----|
| Specific person/system | **Business Actor** / **Application Component** | Role |
| Responsibility pattern | **Business Role** | Actor |
| Collaboration | **Business Collaboration** | Multiple separate actors |
| External access point | **Interface** | Component |

### Behavior: What Is Performed?

| Need to model... | Use | Not |
|------------------|-----|-----|
| Sequence with defined result | **Process** | Function |
| Ongoing capability/grouping | **Function** | Process |
| Externally visible functionality | **Service** | Process/Function |
| Something that triggers behavior | **Event** | Process step |

### Passive Structure: What Is Acted Upon?

| Need to model... | Use | Not |
|------------------|-----|-----|
| Business-level concept | **Business Object** | Data Object |
| Structured application data | **Data Object** | Business Object |
| Perceptible information form | **Representation** | Artifact |
| Deployable file/module | **Artifact** | Data Object |

## Common Confusion Points

| Pair | Use First When... | Use Second When... |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Component vs Function** | Static structural unit | Behavior performed (no structure) |
| **Process vs Function** | Has sequence, start/end | Continuous, no sequence |
| **Service vs Process** | External view, what's offered | Internal, how it's done |
| **Actor vs Role** | Specific entity | Responsibility that can be filled by different actors |

## Output Formats

When creating ArchiMate models, use these formats:

### Textual Description Format
```
Element Type: [Name]
Layer: [Layer Name]
Description: [What this element represents]
Relationships:
- [relationship type] → [Target Element]
```

### Notation Format
```
[Element Type: Name] → [relationship] → [Element Type: Name]
```

Example:
```
[Business Role: Claims Handler] → [assignment] → [Business Process: Handle Insurance Claim]
[Business Process: Handle Insurance Claim] → [realization] → [Business Service: Claims Processing]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Layer consistency**: Keep elements in appropriate layers; use cross-layer relationships to connect
2. **Service orientation**: Expose functionality through services, not direct process/function access
3. **Separation of concerns**: Distinguish who (actors/roles), what (behavior), and what's affected (objects)
4. **Realization chains**: Connect logical to physical through realization relationships
